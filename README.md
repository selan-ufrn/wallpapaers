# Wallpaper Collection

## Where Did I Get These?

This wallpaper collection was downloaded from several sources:

1. Primarily from this [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube)

2. Also from [Imgur](http://imgur.com) and [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg).

3. From the default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions.

## Style of Wallpapers

The vast majority of these wallpapers are nature and landscape photos.  There are a few abstract art wallpapers mixed in.

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
